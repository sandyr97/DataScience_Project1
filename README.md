Jimmy Wrangler: Traveling the world on a mission to discover new data
Steps
1.	Load data into data frame
a.	Movie
b.	Box Office
2.	Merge datasets
a.	Merge based on movie title
3.	Clean data
a.	Check for NAN values
b.	Make sure that years match
4.	Feature Engineering
a.	Check if movie years from both data sets are the same
b.	Add countries that movies filmed with
5.	Visualization
a.	Seaborn graphs
b.	Seaborn heat maps
6.	Conclusions:

I merged two datasets together that had box office data and film information data.
Since majority of my data occurred within last ten years, I decided to investigate the 
data from the 2000s. Through investigating this data, I found that rank and lifetime gross 
are exponentially related where first ranked yields a higher Lifetime gross for domestic 
US sales. I also found that moves that have a higher lifetime gross are not often ranked
very well by IMDB. They are usually ranked at about a 6/10. I also found that the fantasy
and super hero genres have the highest lifetime gross in the 2000s. This is probably due to
franchises like MARVEL and Harry Potter. I used heat maps to look for correlations between rank,
lifetime gross, duration, and votes and also between which countries. I found a surprising but
fairly strong correlation between lifetime gross and duration of the movie, and that the United
States does not usually film with other countries.
